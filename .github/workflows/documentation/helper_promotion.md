# Intro

This workflows does the following: 

- Promotes an unlocked package
- Creates a new GitHub Release
- Adjusts the version number on the minor
    - 1.7.0 would become 1.8.0
- Installs the package in preprod

## Input

- Package ID
    - 18 digit Unlocked Package ID (or even managed packages)
    - Can be found from the Release page on each GitHub repository
- Description field used in the GitHub Release

## Jobs

- Install Package in Preprod (`install-package-preprod`)
    - Basic `sfdx force:package:install`
- Push new version number to master (`push-new-version-number-to-master`)
    - Uses [navikt/github-action-sfdx-version-updater](https://github.com/navikt/github-action-sfdx-version-updater) (GitHub Actions plugin) to update the version number in `sfdx-project.json` (e.g., 1.7.0 => 1.8.0)
    - Creates a pull request that is instantly merged (to avoid GitHub which blocks pushing to master)
    - Needs a GitHub personal access token from an admin to merge (see secrets below)
- Create GitHub Release (`create-release`)
    - Contains the version number, package ID, code coverage, changelog, author and basic description of changes
